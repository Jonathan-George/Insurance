After loading the data, i went on to split the dataset into training and test data.

I then followed up by creating my model after which i then went ahead to get my residuals 

I tested my independent variables for autocorrelation using the durbin-watson test, to ensure that my independent variables are not the same.

And then i checked my dependent variable for a normalty test, using the histogram plot, after which i checked my independent variables for linearity test.


I obtained the summary of my model

I then checked the homoscedasticity of my model to ensure that my model is a good fit for the data, where the residuals showed no bias, so we can say i can say my model fits the assumption of homoscedasticity.


I then finally ploted the residuals and the estimates of each independent variable against the dependent variable.
